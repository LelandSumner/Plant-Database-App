|Description: Plant database for    |
|friend's Internship                |
*-----------------------------------*

# What it does
This is meant to store info about different types of plants and make them searchable
based on different criteria, Then a plant can be selected and it will display all the 
data on that Plant

# Known Bugs and room for improvement

This app has at least one but and possibly more, and has plenty of room for immprovement
I would have fixed and improved it myself, but I did not have the time or energy to do store

- plant information/list doesn't load the first time. once one goes to the info page
of a plant everything runs fine from there

- data page may show multiple of the same image, this is because I wanted every plant to
have an image so for some I used the provided flower or leaves images

- ability to write to stored data, along with how the data is stored can be added/improved

#Getting this from GitHub
if you got this from github I most likely also shared a lot of other files. These are any files
I made/used during the process along with a django server. Many of these may be useless for 
improving the app and none of them are needed, but I thought it might be helpful for anyone who might 
come across this.
